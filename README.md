# MGT4187 Final Project: Improvement Strategy of Customer Lifetime Value

In this report, we took IBMâ€™s car insurance service as a case study to illustrate our improvement in customer lifetime value (CLV) based on our dataset findings. 

After studying the factors associated with CLV, we find that the factors IBM used were all related to the historical consumption data of customers, which was reasonable but ignored potential customers who had not yet made purchases. Besides, we identified two major problems of IBM's operational status. 

1. The CLV concentrates on a low level, with very few of them scatter in high-CLV intervals. 
2. The compensation ratio shows an ascending trend, imposing damages to profits.

We built statistical models in response to the two problems. Differentiated precise marketing is crucial for increasing the CLV. The highlights of our analysis includes: 
1. A **K-Means** model that divides the consumers into three segments and discussed the corresponding strategy of promotion and maintenance. 
2. Predicted the customer response rate based on their features and action records using **random forest** classifier. 
3. Predicted the compensation risk based on **linear regression** and identified the significant factors to the risk, which could assist in the adjustment of premium policy and risk assessment schemes.

Our solution provides a new perspective for IBM to have a better knowledge of its customers and evaluate the risk of compensation. The outcome analysis could serve for the formulation of a detailed consumer management plan and further improvement of information governance.
